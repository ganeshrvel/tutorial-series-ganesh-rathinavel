### Introduction

#### I have invested a lot of my time and energy researching and implementing many common and rare cases of algorithms, logic and code. Most of these implementations aren't available online and I think it wouldn't be fair if I don't share my research outputs with the community.

#### I have tried my best to implement the code by keeping the best practices in my mind for the respective programming domain. Feel free to play around with the codes and contribute to the cause.
